## Feature Engineering for SVM, Logistic Regression & Decision Tree

### Dataset Format
The dataset contains categories of items and item description from an ecommerce website.

### Feature Engineering
Applied 3 feature engineering techniques to SVM, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifier.  

### Hyper-parameter Exploration
Tried different hyper-parameters for each classifier and compared the accuracy of the models for such settings. For feature engineering, fixed the best set of features that were found previously.

### OneVsRest Exploration
Since this is a 4-class classification problem, we got 4 OneVsRest accuracy (macro-F1) scores. Implemented OneVsRest and found all the individual accuracy (macro-F1)  scores and then found the average accuracy  (macro-F1).
